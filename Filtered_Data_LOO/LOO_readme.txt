In this section, we look at the data for a leave-one-out approach. For each folder, you will find the participants' numbers. If you click on one participant's folder, you get two objects. The one with the title "missing" is the one containing every participant except the current folder's participant's number.

Let’s take another approach with an example:

if you click on FastGestures -> P000_Missing, then you'll see two objects:

->FG_P000, which only contains the data of the participant #0000.
->FG_P000, which contains all the participants’ data EXCEPT participant #000.

Concerning the firsts folders:
->FastGestures contains data of fast gestures using BOTH hands concatenated as “one” hand.
->FastGestures_LH_Only contains data of fast gestures using only the left hand.
->FastGestures_RH_Only contains data of fast gestures using only the right hand.
->SlowGestures contains data of slow gestures using BOTH hands concatenated as “one” hand.
->SlowGestures_LH_Only contains data of slow gestures using only the left hand.
->SlowGestures_RH_Only contains data of slow gestures using only the right hand.
